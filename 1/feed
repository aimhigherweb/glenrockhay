Winter herbages etc are wonderful additions to a standing body of dry feed from summer. They generally don't have the bulk or longevity of feed to pull you through the year. I never budget on getting winter herbages in a tropical or sub-tropical system (wherever winter perennials don't grow). If you get them fantastic, treat them as a bonus &ndash; don't rely on them.</span></div>]]>
