phase&nbsp;II&nbsp;would be later childhood and adolescence when we change shoe sizes every second month and eat our parents out of house and home.<br /><br />(Incidentally, if anyone were to consider cannibalism, this is when&nbsp;we&rsquo;d be the best eating).&nbsp;After that, we are left going to seed: phase&nbsp;III.&nbsp;<em style="">So what does this mean for getting the best nutrition out of our pastures?</em><br /><br />While phase&nbsp;I&nbsp;involves high quality food, (in fact even we eat lucerne at phase&nbsp;I&nbsp;as alfalfa sprouts), the quantity is not there.&nbsp;A further problem is that grazing at this stage is likely to kill the young plants.&nbsp;At this stage it is best to rest the pasture and provide alternative feed sources to animals.<br /><br />Phase&nbsp;III&nbsp;has the opposite problem in that the quantity is there but the quality isn&rsquo;t.&nbsp;All of the nutrition&rsquo;s is being sucked out of the plant and into the seeds, eventually leaving behind empty cellulose fibre.<br /><br />Cattle and other ruminants can make better use of this than horses as long as a protein source is provided due to the bacteria in their stomach (rumen).&nbsp;As protein is the first nutrient to decline in phase&nbsp;III, supplementing with a high protein feed (eg: pure lucerne) would be most appropriate.<br /><br />It is phase&nbsp;II&nbsp;that provides the quality feed in sufficient quantity.<br /><br /><em style="">Can we do anything to keep that pasture in phase&nbsp;</em><em style="">II</em><em style="">?</em>Yes.&nbsp;By grazing off or mowing the pastures we can delay the setting of seed, keeping it in phase&nbsp;II.<br /><br />Avoid overgrazing though or the pasture can be pushed right back to phase&nbsp;I.&nbsp;You may notice in some paddocks that there are coarse clumps of older grasses interspersed with short cropped grasses that the animals always seem to pick on.<br /><br />The rank, older grasses are in phase&nbsp;III&nbsp;and therefore are left alone, while the other grasses,&nbsp;which are fresher and sweeter are eaten right back to phase&nbsp;I&nbsp;where they are struggling to survive.&nbsp;The solution here is to mow or burn the older clumps and let the paddock rest occasionally to let the overgrazed grasses recover.<br /><br />Towards the end of the summer/autumn growing period, many pasture species have a last effort at reaching maturity and often set seed even if not fully grown.&nbsp;This should be allowed, to encourage a thicker, more resilient pasture in the following&nbsp;year.&nbsp;I<br /><br />In summary, we should rest pastures in phase&nbsp;I, aim to keep pastures in phase&nbsp;II&nbsp;for as long as possible and allow phase&nbsp;III&nbsp;to occur at the end of the growing season.<br /><br />We should also be mindful of when pastures may or may not be providing everything an animal needs.</div>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Practical feeding of horses]]></title><link><![CDATA[http://www.glenrockhay.com/articles/practical-feeding-of-horses]]></link><comments><![CDATA[http://www.glenrockhay.com/articles/practical-feeding-of-horses#comments]]></comments><pubDate>Wed, 17 Sep 2008 09:04:45 GMT</pubDate><category><![CDATA[Uncategorized]]></category><guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.glenrockhay.com/articles/practical-feeding-of-horses</guid><description><![CDATA[When a horse is doing muscular work, its main requirement is a liberal supply of energy.&nbsp;Mineral and vitamin requirements for a working horse, however, are not much more than those required by an idle horse.&nbsp;It should be noted, however, that brood mares require a good supply of protein, minerals and vitamins during pregnancy, and these requirements will increase even further while nursing foals.

They include:</span><br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span><strong style="">Wild turnip and radish</strong><span style="">&nbsp;(members of the brassica family along with radish, broccoli, etc), which show up as thick strong stalks with no leaves, or as young plants that smell a bit like broccoli.</span><br /><strong style="">Milk thistle</strong><span style="">&nbsp;&ndash; a common garden weed in winter/spring well liked by chooks and horses.

It can be itchy when handling so is definitely not the sort of hay in which to romp.</span><br /><strong style="">Swamp pannicum/barnyard millet&nbsp;</strong><span style="">&ndash; another soft, fine palatable grass that produces a millet like seed.

It will identify itself by sticking to your pants legs and burrowing in needing to be pulled out. In large numbers it has been known to cause mouth ulcers in horses; probably due to the seed getting stuck up under the lips and causing irritation.</li><li style="">Khaki weed, a low growing plant that produces a mass of very sharp prickles. These are at their worst in the peak of summer.

When the mane lies close to the neck it gives the illusion of a slimmer neck.<br /></div>  <div>  <!--BLOG_SUMMARY_END--></div>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="">When you are just starting, it is always a good idea to practice banding your horse&rsquo;s mane early in the week prior to your show. This gives you an idea how long it will take and how well your horse will stand for you while you are banding. When you first start it will usually take several times to get the mane looking as good as you would like it to look, but hang in there, it comes with experience.</span><br /><br /><span style=""></span><span style="">Braiding bands, the color depends on preference [white bands on a black mane look good, IF you do an even job of banding] I&rsquo;ve never tried black bands on a white mane.</span><br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span><span style="">*Alligator clips</span><br /><span style="">*Small fine toothed comb</span><br /><span style="">*Step stool (work so that you are level to or slightly above your horse&rsquo;s mane)</span><br /><span style="">*Pouch or pocket to hold bands, if possible</span><br /><span style="">*Quick Braid - a mane training spray that offers very good grip and control of the mane</span><br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span><span style="">1) Spray Quick Braid, spritz a 2&Prime; section of mane with the training spray, starting at the bridle path. Next, separate out a &frac12; inch section of hair. While holding this section, use an alligator clip to hold the mane to the left of you securely out of your way. As you work down the mane, you may need to use an alligator clip on both sides of the mane to keep the hair out of your most current band. The Quick Braid gives you added grip over the hair as well as holding the mane into place when you are finished.</span><br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span><span style="">2) Pull the &frac12;&rdquo; section thru a band holding the hair as close to the neck as possible, wrap the band around the hair sections several times until tight, twisting the band after each loop keeping the hair in the same hand - this forces the twist to always be on the same side of the hair. Keeping the twist underneath is also supposed to help the mane lie flat.</span><br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span><span style="">3) Go on to the next section of mane and separate out another &frac12;&rdquo; section of mane. Repeat the banding procedure, using an alligator clip to keep both sides of the mane out of your way.</span><br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span><span style="">4) When you are completely finished, tighten the bands and then trim the excess length off the mane. To tighten a band: from underneath a band, grasp a small section from each side of the band and pull down and outwards staying close to the horse&rsquo;s neck.</span><br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span><span style="">5) If you are banding the day prior to your show, use a slinky to keep the mane free of shavings and clean. This also flattens the mane more and on some horses this looks great and on some it looks bad. You need to know which is does for your horse.</span><br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span><span style="">You can either band the forelock or braid the forelock. Use a quick spritz of Quick Braid before a class to help hold down stray hairs. I do not leave the forelock banded or braided overnight - if the horse rubs the forelock or it the forelock catches on something, the entire forelock could be pulled out or thinned greatly.</span><br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span><span style="">Depending on the thickness of your horse&rsquo;s mane, you may need to make your sections of hair larger or small than &frac12;&rdquo;.</span><br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span><strong style="">Hints:</strong><span style="">&nbsp;The below tips will help solve a few problems you may encounter.</span><br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span><span style="">To visually lengthen a short neck, band smaller hair sections than &frac12; inch. This will give you more bands per mane, creating a visually longer-looking neck.</span><br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span><span style="">If your horse has a thick, coarse mane, thin it out before banding, and keep your sections at about three-eighths of an inch, so the bands will lie flat.</span><br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span><span style="">Some horses may have thin spots in their manes and you will find a combination of the band sections will have to be used - experiment to find out what looks good with your horse and your situation.</span><br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span><span style="">Trim the mane AFTER banding, because no matter how straight you trim the mane prior to banding you will always find it necessary to trim again AFTER banding.

As a rule this would need to be at least 2 months, but could be up to several years. (though there aren&rsquo;t too many people that can hang on to hay for longer than a year).&nbsp;The problem with this description is that it doesn&rsquo;t distinguish between good quality hay and poor quality hay. Thus when asking for shedded hay always ask about the quality. For example a 20 yr old house could be a mansion, or a fibro shack, the age only tells you so much.&nbsp;Advantages of prime hay are that it is of a slightly higher moisture content, resulting in less leaf loss which often occurs on the more brittle shedded hay, (most of the nutrients are in the leaf and the stems are mostly fibre), softer texture, prettier colour, and the guarantee of quality. The down side is that it often gives animals the runs. Shedded hay is less likely to go straight through an animal, due to the reduction in the more mobile nutrients during&nbsp;the first month after storage. It has also proved that it is not going to go off, whereas fresh hay may still go mouldy if the moisture level is too high. The major disadvantage is its brittleness which can be overcome by soaking prior to feeding if a problem.&nbsp;It comes down in the end to what works for your animals. If they like it and do well on it then you&rsquo;re probably doing the right thing.</span><br /></div>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Management of pastures for horses]]></title><link><![CDATA[http://www.glenrockhay.com/articles/management-of-pastures-for-horses]]></link><comments><![CDATA[http://www.glenrockhay.com/articles/management-of-pastures-for-horses#comments]]></comments><pubDate>Tue, 01 Nov 2005 09:25:13 GMT</pubDate><category><![CDATA[Uncategorized]]></category><guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.glenrockhay.com/articles/management-of-pastures-for-horses</guid><description><![CDATA[Horses are hard on pastures.&nbsp;Unlike cattle, horses have upper incisors and mobile lips which enable them to selectively and heavily graze pastures.&nbsp;&ldquo;Horse&rdquo; pastures are easily recognized because they have alternating areas of heavily and lightly grazed pasture.&nbsp;This pattern is referred to as &ldquo;lawns&rdquo; and &ldquo;rough&rdquo;.
